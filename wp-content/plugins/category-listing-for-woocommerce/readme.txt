Separate your WooCommerce products and categories. This plugin is a simple yet effective way of listing your categories and products separately. Easy setup. Install and activate only. Requires WooCommerce.

== Description ==
 
I was never really happy with the way WooCommerce shows both categories and products in the same list. Therefor I created a little plugin to split the two lists. It’s important that you DON’T ask WooCommerce to “Show categories and products” in the Customizing Tab. Set it to the default “Show products” and the separate listing for categories will automatically be added.

The frontend is by default in English, but is also available in German, Spanish, Danish and Russian. POT included for easy translation with [Poedit](https://poedit.net/), WPML or Polylang.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the Category Listing for WooCommerce plugin to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory or through the Plugins and Add New section in the WordPress Dashboard.
2. Activate the plugin through the Plugins menu in WordPress
3. That's all!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will the plugin create a separate listing for categories? =

Yes, all your categories will be shown above the product list on archive pages.

= Will I be able to determine what pages will show the category listing? =

No, at the moment the plugin is always showing the categories above the products. If the current category doesn’t have any subcategories, no categories will be shown.

== Screenshots ==
